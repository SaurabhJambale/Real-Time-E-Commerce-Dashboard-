Abstract:

In today's data-driven world, organizations require efficient solutions for processing, analyzing, and visualizing streaming data to gain timely insights and make informed decisions. This project presents the design and implementation of a comprehensive real-time data pipeline leveraging Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, MongoDB, and Tableau for seamless data ingestion, processing, storage, and visualization.

The project begins with a diverse dataset comprising information on products, customers, and transactions. Apache Kafka serves as the backbone of the streaming platform, facilitating the ingestion of data in real-time. Producers publish data to Kafka topics, while brokers ensure reliable and scalable distribution to consumers.

Apache Spark, as a powerful distributed computing framework, acts as a consumer to retrieve streaming data from Kafka topics. Leveraging Spark's streaming capabilities, the data undergoes transformation and analysis to extract valuable insights. The processed data is then seamlessly integrated with MongoDB, a flexible NoSQL database, for efficient storage and retrieval.

The integration with MongoDB enables the persistence of structured data in JSON-like documents, allowing for flexible querying and data retrieval. Furthermore, MongoDB's scalability and performance make it an ideal choice for storing real-time streaming data.

The final phase of the project involves visualization and analysis using Tableau, a leading data visualization tool. Tableau connects to MongoDB as a data source, enabling the creation of interactive dashboards and reports. These visualizations empower stakeholders to explore trends, identify patterns, and derive actionable insights from the streaming data.

Overall, this project demonstrates a robust end-to-end solution for building a real-time data pipeline, from data ingestion to visualization. By leveraging the strengths of Kafka, Spark, MongoDB, and Tableau, organizations can unlock the potential of streaming data analytics, enabling data-driven decision-making in real-time.
