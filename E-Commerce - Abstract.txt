Title: Unified E-commerce Analytics Dashboard: Kafka, Spark, Tableau, and MongoDB Integration for Real-time Insights

Abstract:

In the rapidly evolving landscape of e-commerce, the need for real-time analytics is crucial for informed decision-making and the idea for the project is comes from the diverse dataset comprising information on products, customers, and transactions. 

This project presents a comprehensive solution for developing an E-commerce Analytics Dashboard by seamlessly integrating Kafka for data streaming, Spark for efficient data processing, Tableau for advanced visualization, and MongoDB as an interface between Tableau and Spark.

The project begins with Kafka acting as a distributed event streaming platform, capturing and relaying real-time data from diverse sources such as online transactions, customer interactions, and inventory updates. 

Spark, a powerful and scalable data processing engine, is employed to consume and process the Kafka topics, ensuring efficient handling of large-scale streaming data. 

The processed data is then stored in MongoDB, providing a flexible and scalable data store that acts as an intermediary between the analytical processing in Spark and the visualization layer in Tableau.

Tableau, a robust business intelligence tool, is utilized to create dynamic and interactive dashboards, enabling stakeholders to explore and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) in real-time. 

The integration with MongoDB ensures seamless data connectivity between Tableau and Spark, allowing for a streamlined and efficient flow of data for visualization.

This project not only demonstrates the integration of cutting-edge technologies such as Kafka, Spark, Tableau, and MongoDB but also addresses the challenges of real-time data processing and analytics in the dynamic e-commerce domain.

The resulting E-commerce Analytics Dashboard serves as a comprehensive tool for businesses seeking to gain actionable insights, improve decision-making, and enhance overall performance in the highly competitive e-commerce landscape
