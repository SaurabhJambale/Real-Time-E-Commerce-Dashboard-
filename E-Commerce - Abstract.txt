Title: Real-time E-commerce Analytics Dashboard: Kafka, Spark, Tableau, and MongoDB Integration for Enhanced Business Insights

Abstract:

This project focuses on developing a robust E-commerce Analytics Dashboard by leveraging a sophisticated tech stack, including Kafka for real-time data streaming, Spark for efficient data processing, Tableau for advanced visualization,

and MongoDB as an intermediary for seamless data flow between Tableau and Spark. 

The project workflow is initiated by Python Faker, which generates realistic e-commerce data, setting the foundation for a diverse dataset.

The project architecture comprises two Kafka broker clusters (Broker 1 and Broker 2), providing a scalable and fault-tolerant environment for handling streaming data. 

The generated e-commerce data is ingested into Kafka topics, serving as a resilient bridge for data communication between producers and consumers.

Apache Spark is employed to consume data from Kafka topics, ensuring efficient and parallelized processing of the diverse e-commerce dataset. 

The computed insights are then pushed to MongoDB, functioning as a flexible and scalable data store. MongoDB acts as a crucial interface between Tableau and Spark, facilitating a seamless transfer of processed data for storage and retrieval.

Tableau, a powerful business intelligence tool, is utilized for real-time visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs) extracted from the e-commerce data. T

he dynamic and interactive dashboards created in Tableau empower stakeholders to gain actionable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product popularity.

The project's unique workflow, incorporating Python Faker for data generation, Kafka for streaming, Spark for processing, MongoDB for storage, and Tableau for visualization, addresses the intricacies of real-time analytics in the dynamic e-commerce landscape. 

The resulting E-commerce Analytics Dashboard offers a comprehensive solution for businesses aiming to enhance decision-making processes and gain a competitive edge in the market.
